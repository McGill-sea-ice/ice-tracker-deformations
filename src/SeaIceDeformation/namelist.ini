#   data_folder:   Absolute path of the folder from which datasets are selected for processing.

#   output_folder: Absolute path of the folder in which the algorithm's outputs are stored.

#   exp:           Name of the current experience. Outputs will be stored under output_folder/exp/.

# Grid
# 
#   riops_grid:   Absolute path of the netcdf file that stores the original RIOPS grid (used 
#                 in M00_d00_crop_grid module).
#   
#   bathymetry:   Absolute path of the netcdf file that stores a bathymetry dataset (used in 
#                 M00_d00_crop_grid module).
#

#
#   ice_tracker:    (S1/RCM) Sea-ice motion tracker

# Processing options
#
#   overwrite: (yes/no) When the overwrite argument is set to 'yes', all raw data sets that have  
#              already been processed will be re-processed and the resulting files for all stages 
#              of data processing will be overwritten. Otherwise, raw data sets that have already
#              been processed will not be re-processed.
#
#   method:    (M00/M01) Method to be used when processing datasets. M00 refers to the method 
#              that uses the RIOPS grid, while M01 refers to the method that uses X/Y coordinates 
#              from the input datasets.

#
#   start_year:  (YYYY) Starting year of the datasets to process.

#
#   start_day:   (DD) Starting day of the datasets to process.
#
#   duration:    Time span (days) of the datasets to process.
