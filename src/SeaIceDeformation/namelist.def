#   data_folder:   Absolute path of the folder from which datasets are selected for processing.

#   riops_grid:   Absolute path of the netcdf file that stores the original RIOPS grid (used

# Processing options
#
#   overwrite: (yes/no) When the overwrite argument is set to 'yes', all raw data sets that have
#              already been processed will be re-processed and the resulting files for all stages
#              of data processing will be overwritten. Otherwise, raw data sets that have already
#              been processed will not be re-processed. In any case, an output NETCDF4 file is
#              written with all datasets listed in config for which there is a calculations CSV file.
#
#   visualise: (yes/no) When the visualise argument is set to 'yes',  plots of total sea-ice de-
#              formations, divergence and shear strain rates are created and saved under
#              output_folder/exp/figs. These plots combine output data from all processed datasets.

# Date options
#
#   start_year:  (YYYY) Starting year of the datasets to process.
