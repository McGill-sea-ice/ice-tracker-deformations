# [parameters]
#   start_date:     Start date of target range {YYYYMMDD}
#
#   end_date:       End date of target range {YYYYMMDD}
#
#   interval:       Desired interval length in hours (Used in area coverage
#                   timeseries and analysis) {int}
#
#   timestep:        Desired timestep to investigate in hours {int}
#
#   tolerance:      Permitted "wiggleroom" on either side of *timestep* to be
#                   investigated. i.e. timestep = 24 and tolerance = 3 will
#                   force the program to consider all files with time intervals
#                   of 24 +-3 hours (21~27 hours).
#
#   resolution:     Resolution of heatmap grid in km (per side). i.e.
#                   resolution = 10 will plot the heatmap with 10x10 km grid cells
